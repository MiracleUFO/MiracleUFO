## Heyyy... I'm Miracle ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Fullstack Developer who loves to create web based, innovative solutions to people problems. 
My toolkit consists mostly of MERN, and it would seem that I'm prone to committing several styling tweak one after the other.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Chartit, an app for quickly calculating statistics and creating downloadable charts for students & businesses.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to optimize Javascript speed  i.e increase runtime and development speed.
- ðŸ‘¯ Hit me up. Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on web applications driving social change and presenting innovative solutions. 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her/They
- âš¡ Fun fact: Supply me with good books, internet connectivity and food and I'm never going out again. (Not so fun, I know...)

Currently open to hauling stuff on interesting projects.
