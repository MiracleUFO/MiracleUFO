## Hey... I'm Miracle ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Web Developer who loves to create web based, innovative solutions to people problems.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ChartIt, a web based application for quickly calculating statistics and building charts
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to build for speed in Javascript i.e increasing runtime and development speed
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on web applications driving social change and presenting innovate solutions
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her/They
- âš¡ Fun fact: Supply me with good books, internet connectivity and food and I'm never going out again. (Not so fun, I know.)

N.B: I'm currently looking for full-time Web Developer roles
