## Hey... I'm Miracle ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Fullstack Web Developer who loves to create web based, innovative solutions to people problems. 
My toolkit consists mostly of MERN, and I'm prone to committing styling tweaks.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Chartit, an app for quickly calculating statistics and creating downloadable charts for students & businesses.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to optimize Javascript speed  i.e increasing runtime and development speed.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on web applications driving social change and presenting innovate solutions. Hit me up.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her/They
- âš¡ Fun fact: Supply me with good books, internet connectivity and food and I'm never going out again. (Not so fun, I know...)

N.B: I'm currently open to Fullstack roles.
