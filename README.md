## Heyyy... I'm Miracle ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Fullstack Software Development Engineer who loves to create web-based, innovative solutions to _people problems_. 
My toolkit consists mostly of MERN, and it would seem that I'm prone to committing several styling tweaks one after the other.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on react-g-translator and some other cool stuff.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to optimize Javascript speed  i.e increase runtime and development speed, webGL, and web3.
- ðŸ‘¯ Hit me up. Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on web applications driving social change and presenting innovative solutions. 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her/They
- âš¡ Fun fact: Supply me with good books, internet connectivity and food and I'm never going out again. (Not so fun, I know...)

Currently open to hauling stuff on interesting projects.
